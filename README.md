# Personalized-Crop-Rotation-Recommendation-System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **machine learning** system to assist farmers in optimizing crop rotation by clustering similar land parcels and predicting the yield potential of different crop choices. By leveraging soil health indicators, climate patterns and historical crop performance, this solution offers data-driven recommendations to help farmers improve crop management, field sustainability and resource optimization.

## Problem Statement
Farmers face challenges in optimizing crop rotations, considering soil health, environmental conditions and past crop performances. This system aims to help farmers make informed decisions on crop rotation by using machine learning to predict crop yields, optimize resources and promote sustainable land management.

## Business Use Cases
* **Yield Optimization**: Suggests crops that match the soil and environmental conditions of each land parcel.
* **Sustainable Land Management**: Ensures crop rotation preserves soil health while maintaining economic profitability.
* **Resource Optimization**: Forecasts resource needs to reduce costs.
* **Environmental Impact Reduction**: Forecasts water needs to avoid overuse of water.

## Skills & Technologies
* **Languages**: Python
* **Libraries/Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, K-Means, Classification Model, Regression Model
* **Domains**: Agriculture, Analytics, Machine Learning

## Approach
## 1. Data Preprocessing
* **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing or inconsistent values in Agriculture dataset.
* **Feature Engineering**: Generate relevant features, such as nutrient ratios and pH levels, to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive power.
* **Normalization**: Standardize continuous variables (e.g., nutrient levels) for better consistency across models.
* **Categorical Encoding**: Encode features like crop history and soil drainage for model compatibility.

## 2. Clustering Similar Land Parcels
* **Clustering Algorithm**: Apply unsupervised clustering techniques K-means to group similar land parcels based on soil, climate, and crop data.
* **Cluster Validation**: Validate clusters using methods like silhouette scores to ensure the quality of the clustering results.
* **Cluster Interpretation**: Label clusters with meaningful descriptions based on shared characteristics (e.g., "High Nutrient, Low Drainage").

## 3. Regression Models for Prediction
* **Expected Yield Prediction**: Use regression models to predict yield potential for different crops in each cluster, considering soil health and climate conditions.
* **Soil Health Prediction**: Model the impact of crop rotation on soil health and quality.
* **Resource Requirements Forecasting**: Predict resource needs such as water, fertilizers, and labor based on historical data.
* **Economic Return Prediction**: Estimate the economic return for each crop in each land parcels incorporating yield potential and crop market prices.

## 4. Insights & Visualization
* **Cluster Visualization**: Create geographic maps displaying clusters and their characteristics for easy decision-making.
* **Comparative Charts**: Visualize crop yield, soil health, economic return comparisons across clusters.
* **Economic Dashboard**: Provide interactive dashboards for farmers to visualize potential economic outcomes of different crop rotation strategies.
